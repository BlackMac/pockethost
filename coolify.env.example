# COOLIFY SETUP NOTES
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. WILDCARD SSL CERTIFICATE
#    Coolify needs to be configured for DNS challenge to get wildcard certs.
#    In Coolify's Traefik settings, configure:
#    - Certificate resolver: letsencrypt
#    - DNS provider: cloudflare (or your provider)
#    - API credentials for your DNS provider
#
# 2. WILDCARD DOMAIN
#    Add *.yourdomain.com as the domain for this service in Coolify
#
# 3. DOCKER SOCKET
#    Ensure the container has access to /var/run/docker.sock
#    This is required for spawning PocketBase instance containers
#
# 4. DATA PERSISTENCE
#    The pockethost-data volume stores all instance data
#    Make sure Coolify's backup includes this volume
